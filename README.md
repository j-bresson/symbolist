# SYMBOLIST
SYMBOLIST is a graphic notation environment for music and multimedia. SYMBOLIST is based on an Open Sound Control (OSC) encoding of symbols representing multi-rate and multidimensional control data, which can be streamed as control messages to audio processing or any kind of media environment. Symbols can be designed and composed graphically, and brought in relationship with other symbols. The environment provides tools for creating symbol groups and stave references, by which symbols maybe timed and used to constitute a structured and executable multimedia score.
