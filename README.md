# symbolist
A library for graphic/symbolic score editing

DOXYGEN :

The Doxygen progam enables the automatic generation of documentation following 
the instructions contained in the configuration file (the Doxyfile).
To generate the doc, download the Doxygen .dmg at http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html.
When the download is completed, add the binaries to your PATH variable :
$ export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Doxygen.app/Resources

Go to the Doxygen directory under your local symbolist repository, then launch the doxygen command :
$ cd /path_to_your_local_repo/Doxygen
$ doxygen Doxyfile

This will create an html directory and with it generate all documentation files.
